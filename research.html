												<h3>Bayesian Analysis of Swift GRB</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Different efforts in measuring star formation rate (SFR) have produced results differing by more than an order of
magnitude.  The rate of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) could be a more direct way to measure SFR in comparison to other
methods.  GRBs are the most energetic astrophysical object in the Universe; they can be seen at high redshifts above ~6.
This unique characteristic makes them a rare tool that could provide insight to the challenge of measuring the SFR of the
early universe.</p>
											<p>To better measure the SFR using long GRBs, it is important to account for the detection efficiency of Swift as a
function of redshift.  Swift uses a complex trigger algorithm with more than 500 trigger criteria, thus introducing
complicated selection effects on GRBs.  Recently in Graff et al (2015), the Swift BAT triggering algorithm was modeled
using machine learning algorithms and the detection efficiency of Swift was measured.</p>
									<p>In this research, we conducted a Bayesian study of the GRB rate distribution.  We considered two models for the GRB
rate: the original model from Graff et al (2015) containing only one break in the redshift function and the new model
using a second break point in the redshift.  The two break function allows a more direct comparison with most estimates
of the SFR which also uses a double-broken-power-law model.</p>

												<h3>Magnetic Shape Memory Alloy Actuator for Nano-Positioning</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The goal of this project is to design, manufacture, and test a precision actuator based on new Magnetic Shape
Memory Alloy (MSMA) material for space applications.  MSMAs have been gaining attention since they perform better
than current crystal materials used for precision actuators.  MSMA have larger strains, higher stiffness, higher
bandwidth, and lower amplifier volt-amp requirements compared to other materials.  They require no lubrication
and can run at cryogenic temperatures, thus allowing them to function for millions of cycles.</p>
											<p>In the martensitic phase, MSMA is composed of different areas with alternating orientations of the easy axis
of magnetization, called the twin variants.  When a magnetic field is applied to the material, there is growth in
the variants aligned with the field.  This causes an overall lengthening of the sample.  When the field is
removed, the elongation is self-supported until an external force is applied to restore the original shape.</p>

												<h3>Magnetic Bearings for Space Flight Applications</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The goal of this project is to reconstruct and operate an existing magnetic bearing system that was developed
by the Electromechanical Systems Branch. During the mid 90â€™s, HIRDLS EOS-CHEM (Earth Observing
System-Chemistry) required an optical chopper that needed to be operated at 5,000 rpm throughout the mission
life. Due to concerns that mechanical bearings might not be able to meet the life requirement, a magnetic bearing
based optical chopper was developed as a parallel effort, but was never flown. Magnetic bearing can reduce
vibrations, allow higher precision, eliminate friction and lubrication, and have a longer life compared
mechanical bearing.</p>
											<p>Reconstruction of the magnetic bearing system required understanding all the details of the magnetic bearing
mechanism, electronics, and controller hardware and software. This required discussions with the engineers who
were originally on the project, digging into documentation that was available, and consulting with dSPACE
technical support. Since there is a multiplicity of sensors, windings, driver circuits, sensor processing
circuits, etc., these all needed to be identified with the magnetic bearing coordinate system. A harness was
designed to connect between the electronics and a dSPACE controller. Matlab/Simulink is where the controller
algorithm resides. Sensor signal voltage range and scale factor was determined, as well as magnetic bearing
parameters, and all circuit gains, in order to develop the closed loop control system. This effort will lead
future magnetic bearing space flight application.</p>
