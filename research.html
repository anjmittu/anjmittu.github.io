										<h2>Bayesian Analysis of Swift GRB</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Different efforts in measuring star formation rate (SFR) have produced results differing by more than an order of 
magnitude.  The rate of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) could be a more direct way to measure SFR in comparison to other 
methods.  GRBs are the most energetic astrophysical object in the Universe; they can be seen at high redshifts above ~6.  
This unique characteristic makes them a rare tool that could provide insight to the challenge of measuring the SFR of the 
early universe.</p>
									<p>To better measure the SFR using long GRBs, it is important to account for the detection efficiency of Swift as a 
function of redshift.  Swift uses a complex trigger algorithm with more than 500 trigger criteria, thus introducing 
complicated selection effects on GRBs.  Recently in Graff et al (2015), the Swift BAT triggering algorithm was modeled 
using machine learning algorithms and the detection efficiency of Swift was measured.</p>
									<p>In this research, we conducted a Bayesian study of the GRB rate distribution.  We considered two models for the GRB 
rate: the original model from Graff et al (2015) containing only one break in the redshift function and the new model 
using a second break point in the redshift.  The two break function allows a more direct comparison with most estimates 
of the SFR which also uses a double-broken-power-law model.</p>

												<h3>Magnetic Shape Memory Alloy Actuator for Nano-Positioning</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The goal of this project is to design, manufacture, and test a precision actuator based on new Magnetic Shape 
Memory Alloy (MSMA) material for space applications.  MSMAs have been gaining attention since they perform better 
than current crystal materials used for precision actuators.  MSMA have larger strains, higher stiffness, higher 
bandwidth, and lower amplifier volt-amp requirements compared to other materials.  They require no lubrication 
and can run at cryogenic temperatures, thus allowing them to function for millions of cycles.</p>
											<p>In the martensitic phase, MSMA is composed of different areas with alternating orientations of the easy axis 
of magnetization, called the twin variants.  When a magnetic field is applied to the material, there is growth in 
the variants aligned with the field.  This causes an overall lengthening of the sample.  When the field is 
removed, the elongation is self-supported until an external force is applied to restore the original shape.</p>

												<h3>Magnetic Bearings for Space Flight Applications</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The goal of this project is to reconstruct and operate an existing magnetic bearing system that was developed 
by the Electromechanical Systems Branch (Code 544). During the mid 90â€™s, HIRDLS EOS-CHEM (Earth Observing 
System-Chemistry) required an optical chopper that needed to be operated at 5,000 rpm throughout the mission 
life. Due to concerns that mechanical bearings might not be able to meet the life requirement, a magnetic bearing 
based optical chopper was developed as a parallel effort, but was never flown. Magnetic bearing can reduce 
vibrations, allow higher precision, eliminate friction and lubrication, and have a longer life compared 
mechanical bearing.</p>
											<p>Reconstruction of the magnetic bearing system required understanding all the details of the magnetic bearing 
mechanism, electronics, and controller hardware and software. This required discussions with the engineers who 
were originally on the project, digging into documentation that was available, and consulting with dSPACE 
technical support. Since there is a multiplicity of sensors, windings, driver circuits, sensor processing 
circuits, etc., these all needed to be identified with the magnetic bearing coordinate system. A harness was 
designed to connect between the electronics and a dSPACE controller. Matlab/Simulink is where the controller 
algorithm resides. Sensor signal voltage range and scale factor was determined, as well as magnetic bearing 
parameters, and all circuit gains, in order to develop the closed loop control system. This effort will lead 
future magnetic bearing space flight application.</p>
